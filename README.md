# after much consideration and talks with the Joint Chiefs of Staff the wiki will no longer be updated and is no longer a place to get information!

the wiki was never updated to reflect the changes made in the 505th and is in no way offical documentation all informations regarding ranks, responabilities and structure can be found in their respective channels on the discord.

**that behing said here is the original description:**

This is the remake and the currently maintained version of the wiki. The old and archived version can be found [here](https://github.com/Costeer/101st-Wiki). This wiki is built using Quartz but heavily modifies the default layout.

#### How Do I Contribute to the Wiki?

First of all, you need to be an active member of the 505th.

If you are already a member, consult the Contributing page found in the wiki.

#### Edited in Obsidian

The content in the wiki (notes and stuff) is edited using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

#### Built Using Quartz

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your notes as a website for free. 
Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease of use.

This is what we use to make the .md (Markdown) files appear in the browser without having to code the logic ourselves.
